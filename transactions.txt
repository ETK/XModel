Use Cases

. Changes made to an ExternalReference with an SQLDirectCachingPolicy can be used to update the database.

. A collection of changes made in the course of a transaction may affect multiple columns, rows and tables.

. Changes need to be tracked because updates to small-data columns should not result in large-data columns being sent to db.
  ChangeSet is not required.  Tables, rows and columns just need to be flagged.
  
. SQLDirectCachingPolicy could flag these changes using special attributes, or using a separate data-structure and map.
  One is fast.  One is non-intrusive.  Non-intrusive prevents users from having to know about special attributes when
  using paths like @*.
