Notes


Type I - Serial Processing Per Connection

  ThreadPoolContext locks model for duration of script.
  
Type II - Concurrent Processing Per Connection

  Locking is performed by LockAction
  
  This model requires more work because dispatches can be processed out of order, which
  violates assumptions made about IDispatcher.
