/**
 * The interface for objects in a hierarchical data model suitable for representing the content of
 * an XML document. Each element has one parent, zero or more attributes and zero or more children.
 * An attribute is a name/value pair where the name is any Java String and the value is any Java
 * Object. The attribute whose name is the empty string may also be accessed by calling the
 * <code>getValue</code> method. An attribute which exists but has not been assigned a value will
 * contain an empty string.
 * <p>
 * The interface supports the listener pattern. A listener implements the IModelListener interface
 * and is registered with an IModelObject via the <code>addModelListener</code> method. The
 * listener receives the following notifications:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Notification when a child is added or removed from the object.
 * <li>Notification when an attribute is set, modified or cleared on the object.
 * <li>Notification when the parent of the object changes.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The interface supports cloning of individual objects as well as entire subtrees. See the
 * <code>cloneTree</code> and <code>cloneObject</code> methods for more information.
