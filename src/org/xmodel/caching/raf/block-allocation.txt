Fixed Block Allocation

1. Start with a file that is divided into several regions that each allocate a fixed block size.

  Region 1 (small)
    32-byte blocks
  
  Region 2 (medium)
    1K blocks
  
  Region 3 (large)
    32K blocks 
    
  
2. Regions are organized in order of increasing block size.

3. When a region is exhausted, it allocates a new block from one of the regions with larger block sizes.
