/** 
 * A further refinement of AbstractCachingPolicy which provides built-in support for secondary caching
 * stages and configuration from metadata annotations culled during preprocessing of a model loaded 
 * from an xml file. This class also supports the definition of a skeleton tree which is automatically
 * created when an external reference is synchronized so that secondary stages are immediately available.
 * This architecture supports resolution of an external reference in three ways.
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>The reference consists solely of information from the external storage location.
 * <li>The reference consists of a skeleton with zero or more secondary stages.
 * <li>The reference is a combination of the previous two methods.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The subclass implementation of the <code>sync</code> method is responsible for applying the skeleton
 * structure. The relative position of the skeleton with respect to elements constructed from information
 * in the external storage location is implementation dependent.
 * <p>
 * <b>Most implementations of ICachingPolicy should use this base class instead of AbstractCachingPolicy.</b>
 * <p>
 * The schema and examples of the metadata annotation are provided in the metadata.xsd and metadata.xml
 * files in this package. Within the metadata annotation is an arbitrary fragment which is passed directly
 * to the caching policy and contains caching policy specific configuration.
