- BNode records need same header as other records.

- BNode records marked as garbage cannot be collected unless new index was successfully written.
  Currently, I'm marking BNode records as garbage differently from other records.  How do these
  get collected?

1. Support non-unique keys.
2. Support multiple keys in the same index.
3. Factor record structure into another class/interface.
4. Circular FileStore.
5. Time limited user transactions to prevent Phil's huge user transaction problem.
6. Support streamed read/write of records.
