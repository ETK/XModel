- IRecordFormat interface needs to always distinguish user records from index records.
  See Analysis class.

1. Support non-unique keys.
2. Support multiple keys in the same index.
3. Factor record structure into another class/interface.
4. Circular FileStore.
5. Time limited user transactions to prevent Phil's huge user transaction problem.
6. Support streamed read/write of records.
