/**
 * An interface for receiving notification when the result of expression has changed.
 * The listener is guaranteed to receive notifications only once per atomic update.
 * The interface provides two types of notification. Since many simple expressions
 * are only changed by the addition or removal of results for a given atomic update,
 * two methods are provided which give that information without incurring a 
 * performance penalty. The receiver can use this information to maintain an
 * unordered version of the result set.
 * <p>
 * When the expression tree cannot provide the above information, the second type
 * of notification is performed. This type of notification only indicates that the
 * expression has changed in some way. It is then the responsibility of the receiver
 * to reevaluate the expression. The state of the model is preserved at the point
 * that the notification method is called. This allows the expression to be 
 * reevaluated against the state of the model before the update was made, as well
 * as reevaluated against the state of the model after the update. The differencing
 * engine can be used to perform a shallow, ordered diff of the two result sets 
 * which will yield precise, ordered notification of the changes.
