/**
 * An interface for receiving notifications of changes to IModelObject instances. This interface is
 * the most basic form of notification and is the basis for all the other listener notification
 * mechanisms (e.g. IPathListener). When a child is added to or removed from a parent IModelObject,
 * there are two notifications generated: first, the child is notified that its parent has changed,
 * and then the parent is notified that a child was added or removed. Performing the notifications
 * in this order gives listeners on the child an opportunity to finish configuring the child before
 * it is added to the model.
 * <p>
 * IModelListener is notified of changes to the value of an IModelObject by calling the 
 * <code>notifyChange</code> method with an empty string for the attribute name.  The value of an
 * object is the result of calling the <code>getValue</code> method on the IModelObject.  The value
 * is usually used to store the text node of an XML element.
 * <p>
 * The IModelObject interface guarantees that each IModelListener will receive notification of all
 * changes made to any object with which it is registered.  To make this possible, an IModelObject
 * implementation must defer changes which are made to it during listener notification.  The object
 * will not change state until after all listeners have been notified.
